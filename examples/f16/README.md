# CSAF F16 Model
  
The F-16 model provided that was taken from 
[AeroBenchVVPython](https://github.com/stanleybak/AeroBenchVVPython). The model was designed to test autopilot and 
analysis methods. No claim is made about its accuracy; the F-16 model is based on a common aircraft model with
additional controllers placed on top of it.
