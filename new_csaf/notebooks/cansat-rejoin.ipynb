    "# CanSat Rejoin Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook demonstrates a multi-agent task scenario modeled with control system analysis framework (CSAF), where a group of satellites attempt to rejoin in formation while avoiding collision with one another.  The spacecraft model was taken from the [AerospaceRL repository on GitHub](https://github.com/act3-ace/aerospaceRL). The simple 2D model uses applied forces to move a satellite\n",
    "agent around on a plane. The coordinate system is relative to a \"chief\" satellite, where chaser satellites are attempting to\n",
    "approach the chief without crashing into it. To create a multi-agent example, four chaser satellites were instantiated around the chief, who attempt to\n",
    "approach the chief satellite without crashing into one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model has a 4D state space, $(x,y)$ position and $(\\dot x, \\dot y)$ velocities. The input space consists of two applied forces,\n",
    "$\\mathbf{F} = (F_x, F_y)^T$. The state evolution function can be written\n",

    "A controller policy is designed to achieve the multi-agent goal, responsible for supplying the forces to all satellites. While the original AerospaceRL benchmark scenario was meant for\n",
    "RL, a simple spring system approach is taken. The input force for each element can be accomplished in three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Construct an undirected graph $\\mathcal G$ of satellites $\\mathcal S$ and connections $\\mathcal C$ to nearby satellites,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal G = (\\mathcal S, \\mathcal C).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    Any satellite $s_i$ has a set of neighbors, $\\text{neighbors} \\subseteq \\mathcal S$, being all satellites with which $s_i$ has connections.\n",
    "2.  Construct a damped spring system by assigning a spring and damping constant to each connection.\n",
    "3.  Solve for the force applied to each node, and use that as a control policy for each satellite. For satellite $s_i$,\n",
    "    the force $F_i$ applied to the input would be a sum of the forces supplied by neighbors,  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{F_i} = \\sum_{s_j \\in \\text{neighbors}} k_p (||\\mathbf r||_2 - r_l) + k_d || \\operatorname{proj}_{\\hat{\\mathbf r}} (\\mathbf v_r)||_2,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    where $\\mathbf r = {\\mathbf x_{j,:2} -\\mathbf  x_{i,:2}}$, $\\mathbf v_r = {\\mathbf x_{j, 2:} - \\mathbf x_{i, 2:}}$, $r_l$ is the spring rest length,\n",
    "    $k_p$ is the spring constant, and $k_d$ is the damping factor. The rest length in this case defines the ideal final distances that\n",
    "    all satellites should have to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, this technique can be done in a centralized or distributed fashion. Notably, should all satellites be able to detect one another\n",
    "symmetrically, step (1) can be accomplished per satellite by $\\epsilon$-ball construction. If the satellites cannot agree who is a valid connection,\n",
    "the graph becomes directed, and the controller no longer represents a spring system.\n",
