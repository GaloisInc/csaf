    "This Jupyter notebook demonstrates a multi-agent task scenario modeled with control system analysis framework (CSAF), where a group of satellites attempt to rejoin in formation while avoiding collision with one another.  The spacecraft model was taken from the [AerospaceRL repository on GitHub](https://github.com/act3-ace/aerospaceRL). The simple 2D model uses applied forces to move a satellite\n",
    "agent around on a plane. The coordinate system is relative to a \"chief\" satellite, where chaser satellites are attempting to\n",
    "approach the chief without crashing into it. To create a multi-agent example, four chaser satellites were instantiated around the chief, who attempt to\n",
    "approach the chief satellite without crashing into one another.\n",

    "A controller policy is designed to achieve the multi-agent goal, responsible for supplying the forces to all satellites. While the original AerospaceRL benchmark scenario was meant for\n",
    "RL, a simple spring system approach is taken. The input force for each element can be accomplished in three steps:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "    Any satellite $s_i$ has a set of neighbors, $\\text{neighbors} \\subseteq \\mathcal S$, being all satellites with which $s_i$ has connections.\n",
    "2.  Construct a damped spring system by assigning a spring and damping constant to each connection.\n",
    "3.  Solve for the force applied to each node, and use that as a control policy for each satellite. For satellite $s_i$,\n",
    "    the force $F_i$ applied to the input would be a sum of the forces supplied by neighbors,  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{F_i} = \\sum_{s_j \\in \\text{neighbors}} k_p (||\\mathbf r||_2 - r_l) + k_d || \\operatorname{proj}_{\\hat{\\mathbf r}} (\\mathbf v_r)||_2,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    where $\\mathbf r = {\\mathbf x_{j,:2} -\\mathbf  x_{i,:2}}$, $\\mathbf v_r = {\\mathbf x_{j, 2:} - \\mathbf x_{i, 2:}}$, $r_l$ is the spring rest length,\n",
    "    $k_p$ is the spring constant, and $k_d$ is the damping factor. The rest length in this case defines the ideal final distances that\n",
    "    all satellites should have to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, this technique can be done in a centralized or distributed fashion. Notably, should all satellites be able to detect one another\n",
    "symmetrically, step (1) can be accomplished per satellite by $\\epsilon$-ball construction. If the satellites cannot agree who is a valid connection,\n",
    "the graph becomes directed, and the controller no longer represents a spring system.\n"
